# GenAI-and-LLMS
This is a repository for resources and projects on GenAI and LLMs

Found this post on LinkedIn: "Ilya Sutskever of OpenAI gave John Carmack the following reading list of approximately 30 research papers and said, â€˜If you really learn all of these, youâ€™ll know 90% of what matters today in AI.â€™ I have added a few more LLM papers that potentially fill the remaining ~9%" by Bhairav M.
